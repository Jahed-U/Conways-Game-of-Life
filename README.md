# Conway's Game of Life â€” Mesa Implementation

This project implements Conway's Game of Life using the Mesa agent-based modelling framework in Python.

## ðŸ”¬ What It Is
Each cell is an agent that updates its state based on the number of alive neighbours, following Conway's famous rules of life and death. The simulation is executed using Mesa's `SimultaneousActivation` scheduler to ensure correct transition dynamics.

## ðŸ’¡ Features
- Built with Python and Mesa
- Random initial seeding
- Easily adjustable grid size
- Modular server-based visualisation (optional)

## ðŸš€ How to Run
```bash
pip install mesa
python "Game of Life.py"
```

## ðŸ§  Why This Project
This simulation is a minimal example of how emergent complexity can arise from simple local interactions â€” a key concept shared with financial market modelling.
